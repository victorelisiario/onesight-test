## The TEST
Now, the test itself:
On this test you'll create a single page application with basic CRUD functions where you'll be able to:

## Tasks
* Have a form for creating/inserting data
* Have a screen for listing data
* Have a screen for viewing row details
* Have a separate form for editing data
* Have an option to remove a single or multiple rows of data

You can save the data within the browser db or any other sort of storage (as long as it is visibile between multiple sessions)
We will evaluate every single implemented screen, code quality, code comments and design

## This test is limited to: 72 hours
The time frame is limited to 72h after you've opened this page so make it count
